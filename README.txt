-------------------------------------------------------------

Set-Up Instructions
----------------------

This program was written in Python using Python 2.7. Please Have Python 2.7 installed in order to run this program. 
A version tested to run in the Python 3x series will possibly be made in the future.

This program should run on any operating system (Windows, Unix, etc.).

Once Python is installed, some extra libraries will also have to be installed in order to run this program. 
Those are:

numpy - http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/

matplotlib - http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html
Also requires dateutil, pytz, pyparsing, and six to run properly which can be found here: 
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib 


After installing Python 2.7 and the relevant extra libraries, this program should compile and run once obtained off of Github.

----
 
Install the Anaconda Python distribution, which provides Python 2.7, iPython and all of its dependencies 
as well as a complete set of open source packages for scientific computing and data science.
Anaconda Download: http://continuum.io/downloads

The Canopy Distribution should also be a viable option, similar to Anaconda.
Canopy Download: https://store.enthought.com/downloads/

If you install one of these distributions, it comes with all of the libraries needed to run this software in Python 2.7.
And so, Anaconda would be the recommended option.

------------------------

This BDNE Visualization program has been optimized to provide the best possible output in as many possible scenarios. 
Some problems/issues still may occur.
Please email me at ciccons@mcmaster.ca if any problems require a fix or update to the software.
