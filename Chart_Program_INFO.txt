-------------------------------------------------------------

Set-Up Instructions
----------------------

This program was written in Python using Python 2.7. Please Have Python 2.7 installed in order to run this program. 
A version tested to run in the Python 3x series will possibly be made in the future.
This program should run on a Windows machine or a Unix machine.

Once Python is installed, some extra libraries will also have to be installed in order to run this program. 
Those are:

numpy - http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/

matplotlib - http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html
Also requires dateutil, pytz, pyparsing, and six to run properly which can be found here: 
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib 


After installing Python 2.7 and the relevant extra libraries, this program should compile and run once obtained off of Github.

----

An iPython Notebook Version is available with a Text-Based Interface. 
Install the Anaconda Python distribution, which provides Python 2.7, IPython and all of its dependencies 
as well as a complete set of open source packages for scientific computing and data science.
Anaconda Download: http://continuum.io/downloads

The Canopy Distribution should also be a viable option, similar to Anaconda.
Canopy Download: https://store.enthought.com/downloads/

If you install one of these distributions, it comes with all of the libraries needed to run this Chart program in Python 2.7.

------------------------

This BDNE Chart program is still in the process of being optimized. 
Some problems/issues may occur but they will be dealt with quickly.
